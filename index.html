    <h4 id="scrambleRules">Scramble Details</h4>
    <p>
      At 7 pm on Thursday, April 7, we will stream live via Facebook to announce
      the start of the contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will be two sets of genres that we will draw from for each team. You
      and your team will choose which genre to go for. We will also announce
      THREE surprise elements that MUST be included in your film. This is the
      fun part and I can’t say what they will be until the announcement. In the
      past we had a pattern of PHRASE, OBJECT, and CAMERA ANGLE/FRAMING.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, “Bless Your Heart”, object had to be a stuffed animal, and
      the “Wilson” shot where one character’s face was only seen from the nose
      up, like Wilson in Home Improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we announce the surprise elements you and your team are off to
      the races!
    </p>
    <p>
      You start writing your script. Plan your shoot and get it edited and
      returned to us by 7 pm Sunday evening, April 10.
    </p>
    <p>To summarize the requirements for your film:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>must meet your chosen genre</li>
      <li>must include all three surprise elements</li>
      <li>must be between 3 and 7 mins in length</li>
      <li>
        keep it PG-13 or lighter as we are working with a family event as part
        of the comic and pop culture expo.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      There will be various awards given. Once we see how many teams sign up, we
      will announce what those awards will be. The awards ceremony will take
      place at the VBC on Friday April 22. We will livestream the event for
      those who participate out of town.
